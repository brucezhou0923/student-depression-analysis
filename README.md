# Student Depression Analysis

This project investigates the factors influencing depression among college students using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The analysis focuses on three key predictors: **academic pressure**, **financial stress**, and **study satisfaction**, and examines their relationship with student depression.

## Dataset
- Source: [Student Depression Dataset on Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/student-depression-dataset)
- ~140,000 student survey responses
- Target variable: Depression (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Predictor variables: Academic Pressure, Financial Stress, Study Satisfaction (Likert scales)

## Methodology
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries used:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels
- Data cleaning and filtering using custom Python functions
- Correlation and regression analysis to explore predictor relationships
- Visualizations created to identify significant patterns

## Key Findings
- Academic and financial stress are positively associated with higher depression rates.
- Study satisfaction appears to buffer students against depressive symptoms.
- Visualizations and statistical models support actionable insight into student well-being.
